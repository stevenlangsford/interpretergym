MADLIB PROMPTS:
Create a list of eg professions.
Create a bunch of templates where X spins through the list.
Create a bunch of optional flavor-text prefixes and suffixes that go with everything (make it interesting, lots of detail, casual style, slightly formal style etc, deliver the monologue deadpan without flagging that anything is unusual, but make part of it surreal)
In chinese / in english explicit, so languages take turns being first.
Have some always-on suffixes eg javascript array formatting.

Ring the changes! Shuffle the output, write 'em to a file, drip-feed to poe and delete the prompts from the master file as you go.

Probaby good to hit 'retry' and get two copies of each. They'll be sorta different enough (and possibly the existence of some near-matches will be good to discourage memorizing?)

1) please output a list of 30 specialized jobs in the X profession for

DONE
{medical, legal, public service, finance, hospitality, science, education, government, arts, trades, some joke entries
