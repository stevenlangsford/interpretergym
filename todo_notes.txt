Let mempalace get texts from everywhere: the monologues it's using now, plus the bilang cloze texts which it can't currently see.



**FIGURE OUT A HOST: must support backend db.**

(then probably also can npm install chinese number dependency)

Put all the text resources in a psql database and fetch them as needed, carrying them around as js is real bad.

Add a 'track my stats' page to record pbs and/or time spent for each exercise

Revisit the n-back task: clone a 'real' presentation format and start collecting data? Can you see anything interesting re item interference?
