你好，我正在寻求关于一个可能存在违约情况的法律建议。,"Hello, I'm seeking legal advice regarding a potential breach-of-contract situation."
当然，我来帮你。你能提供一些关于这个情况的细节吗？,"Of course, I'm here to help. Can you please provide some details about the situation?"
我和雇主签订了一份合同，约定提供特定的服务，但他们没有按照合同中规定的义务履行。,"I entered into a contract with my employer to provide certain services, but they have failed to fulfill their obligations as outlined in the agreement."
我明白了。你能具体说明没有履行的义务的性质，以及合同中提到的任何相关截止日期或里程碑吗？,I see. Can you specify the nature of the obligations that were not fulfilled and any relevant deadlines or milestones mentioned in the contract?
合同规定雇主要提供我所需的设备和培训，但他们两者都没有兑现。此外，他们一直延迟支付我的服务费。,"The contract stipulated that my employer would provide me with necessary equipment and training, but they haven't followed through on either. Additionally, they have consistently delayed payments for my services."
谢谢你提供这些信息。你是否已经以书面形式记录了这些问题，并试图通过书面方式向雇主提出过解决？,Thank you for sharing that information. Have you documented these issues and attempted to address them with your employer in writing?
是的，我已经记录了我遇到的问题，并通过电子邮件向雇主表达了我的担忧。,"Yes, I have maintained a record of the problems I've encountered, and I have communicated my concerns to my employer via email."
这是一个不错的步骤。现在，让我们讨论一下你的合同条款。是否有关于争议解决或违约补救的规定？,"That's a good step. Now, let's discuss the terms of your contract. Are there any provisions related to dispute resolution or remedies for breach of contract?"
我记得合同中有一项争议解决条款，提到了调解或仲裁作为潜在的选择。然而，我对具体情况并不完全确定。,"I recall there being a dispute resolution clause mentioning mediation or arbitration as potential options. However, I'm not entirely sure about the specifics."
明白了。我会审查合同，更好地了解争议解决规定，并评估你的法律选择。同时，如果你能提供一份合同副本和与违约相关的任何书信或证据，将会非常有帮助。,"Understood. I'll review the contract to better understand the dispute resolution provisions and assess your legal options. In the meantime, it would be helpful if you could provide me with a copy of the contract and any relevant correspondence or evidence related to the breach."
当然。我会尽快整理这些文件，并与你分享。,Certainly. I can gather those documents and share them with you as soon as possible.
太好了。一旦我审查了这些材料，我们可以安排会面，讨论你的案件的强弱以及可能的下一步行动。重要的是确定是通过谈判、调解还是法律诉讼来解决问题是最合适的方式。,"Great. Once I have reviewed the materials, we can schedule a meeting to discuss the strength of your case and potential next steps. It's important to determine whether negotiation, mediation, or legal action is the most appropriate course of action."
感谢你的指导。我感谢你在解决这个问题上的帮助。,Thank you for your guidance. I appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter.
不用客气。我在这里帮助你应对这个情况，保护你的权益。让我们一起努力找到解决违约问题并寻求一个有利的结果的最佳途径。,You're welcome. I'm here to help you navigate this situation and protect your rights. Let's work together to find the best approach to address the breach of contract and seek a favorable resolution.
我期待与你合作。,I look forward to working with you.
