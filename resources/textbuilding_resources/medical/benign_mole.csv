下午好，约翰先生。您今天有什么问题需要咨询？,"Good afternoon, Mr. Johnson. How can I help you today?"
您好，医生。我非常担心我手臂上的这个斑点。我读了一些关于皮肤癌症状的资料，我觉得可能是一种严重的情况。,"Hi, Doctor. I'm really concerned about this spot on my arm. I've been reading about skin cancer symptoms, and I think it might be something serious."
我理解您的担忧，约翰先生。让我来看看。嗯，根据我的检查，这个斑点看起来是良性痣。没有显示出任何令人担忧的皮肤癌症症状。,"I understand your concerns, Mr. Johnson. Let's take a look at it. Hmm, based on my examination, the spot appears to be a benign mole. It doesn't exhibit any concerning signs of skin cancer."
医生，您确定吗？我已经担心了几个星期了。在我看来，它看起来并不正常。,"Are you sure, Doctor? I've been worrying about it for weeks now. It just doesn't look right to me."
我完全理解您的焦虑，约翰先生。然而，我接受了识别潜在皮肤癌症病例的训练，在这种情况下，我确信是不太可能的。该斑点的特征更符合无害痣的特点。不过，如果您希望绝对确定，我可以安排进行活检。,"I completely understand your anxiety, Mr. Johnson. However, I've been trained to identify potential skin cancer cases, and in this instance, I'm confident that it's unlikely. The characteristics of the spot align more with a harmless mole. Nonetheless, I can order a biopsy if you'd like to be absolutely certain."
活检？那不是侵入性的吗？我不确定是否愿意接受那个。,A biopsy? Isn't that invasive? I'm not sure if I want to go through that.
我完全理解您的犹豫，约翰先生。活检是一种更为确切的检测方法，但考虑到该斑点的外观和我的专业知识，我真的认为是不必要的。然而，如果这能给您带来安心，我们可以进一步讨论这个程序，并解答您可能有的任何疑虑。,"I completely understand your hesitation, Mr. Johnson. A biopsy is a more definitive test, but given the appearance of the spot and my expertise, I genuinely believe it's unnecessary. However, if it would provide you with peace of mind, we can discuss the procedure further and address any concerns you may have."
谢谢您，医生。我感谢您的细致和理解。我会相信您的专业意见，尽量不过多担心。,"Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness and understanding. I'll trust your professional opinion and try not to worry too much."
听到这个很好，约翰先生。请记住，如果您有任何新的或令人担忧的症状，请随时联系我。我在这里支持您，确保您的健康。,"That's great to hear, Mr. Johnson. Remember, if you have any new or concerning symptoms, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to support you and ensure your well-being."
