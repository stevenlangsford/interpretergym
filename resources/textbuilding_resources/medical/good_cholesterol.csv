下午好，史密斯先生。 我有您最近的血液检查结果，以评估您的胆固醇水平。 我很高兴地通知您，结果非常好。,"Good afternoon, Mr. Smith. I have the results of your recent blood test to assess your cholesterol levels. I'm pleased to inform you that the results are very good."
噢，这是个好消息，医生！ 我一直在努力保持健康的生活方式，所以我很高兴听到这个消息。,"Oh, that's great news, Doctor! I've been working hard to maintain a healthy lifestyle, so I'm really happy to hear that."
是的，你的努力得到了回报。 您的总胆固醇水平在正常范围内，HDL 较高，而 LDL 较低。 这是一个极好的结果。,"Yes, your efforts have paid off. Your total cholesterol level is within the normal range, and your HDL is high while your LDL is low. This is an excellent outcome."
噢，这是个好消息，医生！ 听到这个我就放心了。 但是，我必须承认，我对 HDL 和 LDL 这两个术语有点困惑。 你能给我解释一下吗？,"Oh, that's wonderful news, Doctor! I'm relieved to hear that. But, I must admit, I'm a bit confused about the terms HDL and LDL. Could you please explain them to me?"
当然，我很乐意解释。 HDL 代表高密度脂蛋白，通常被称为“好胆固醇”。 它通过将胆固醇从动脉运回肝脏并在肝脏中进行处理和消除来在您的身体中发挥保护作用。," Absolutely, I'll be glad to explain. HDL stands for high-density lipoprotein, often referred to as good cholesterol. It plays a protective role in your body by carrying cholesterol away from the arteries and back to the liver, where it's processed and eliminated."
好吧，所以它是一种会自行排出的垃圾，并带走其他胆固醇。 听起来确实不错。 LDL呢？," Ok, so it's a kind of trash that takes itself out, and takes other cholesterol with it. That does sound good. But what about LDL?"
我想你可以这么说，是的。 LDL代表低密度脂蛋白，通常被称为“坏胆固醇”。 低密度脂蛋白将胆固醇从肝脏运送到体内的细胞。 然而，当血液中的低密度脂蛋白过多时，它会在动脉中积聚，导致斑块形成并增加患心脏病的风险。,"I guess you could say that, yes. LDL stands for low-density lipoprotein, often referred to as bad cholesterol. LDL carries cholesterol from the liver to the cells in your body. However, when there's an excess of LDL in your bloodstream, it can build up in the arteries, leading to plaque formation and increasing the risk of heart disease."
我现在明白了。 因此，低密度脂蛋白是一种胆固醇，如果我体内的胆固醇含量过多，就会导致问题。 如何保持高 HDL 水平和低 LDL 水平？,"I understand now. So, LDL is the cholesterol that can cause problems if there's too much of it in my body. How can I keep my HDL high and LDL low?"
保持健康的生活方式是关键。 定期锻炼、均衡饮食以及避免食用饱和脂肪和反式脂肪含量高的食物有助于提高 HDL 水平并降低 LDL 水平。 如有必要，服用任何处方药以有效控制胆固醇也很重要。,"Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is key. Regular exercise, a balanced diet, and avoiding foods high in saturated and trans fats can help increase your HDL levels and lower your LDL levels. It's also important to take any prescribed medication, if necessary, to manage cholesterol effectively."
谢谢您的澄清，医生。 了解 HDL 和 LDL 的区别并了解它们的重要性是件好事。 我将确保遵循健康的生活方式，并采取必要的措施来保持这些良好的结果。,"Thank you for the clarification, Doctor. It's good to know the difference and understand the importance of HDL and LDL. I'll make sure to follow a healthy lifestyle and take the necessary steps to maintain these good results."
不客气。 我很高兴能帮助您澄清这一点。 请记住，如果您还有任何其他问题或疑虑，请随时与我们联系。 我们将共同继续监测您的胆固醇水平并确保您的整体健康。,"You're welcome. I'm glad I could help clarify that for you. Just remember, if you have any further questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out. Together, we'll continue to monitor your cholesterol levels and ensure your overall well-being."
