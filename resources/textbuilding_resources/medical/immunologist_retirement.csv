各位听众们，我即将退休，是一名免疫学家。今天我想分享一个个人故事，这个故事激励我最初选择成为免疫学家。,"Ladies and gentlemen, I am about to retire as an immunologist. Today, I would like to share a personal story that motivated me to become an immunologist in the first place."
很多年前，我年轻时的妹妹患上了一种自身免疫性疾病。我亲眼目睹了她长期受病痛折磨的样子，这深深触动了我。我决心投身免疫学的研究，希望能够为病患提供更好的治疗和希望。,"Many years ago, when I was young, my sister was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease. I witnessed firsthand the suffering she endured, and it deeply moved me. I made a commitment to dedicate myself to the study of immunology, hoping to provide better treatments and hope for patients."
当我真正开始从事这个工作时，有几件事情让我感到惊讶。首先是免疫系统的复杂性。我惊讶于它的精密运作和各种细胞、分子之间的相互作用。这个微小而强大的系统真是令人惊叹。,"When I actually started doing the job, there were several things that surprised me. The first was the complexity of the immune system. I was amazed by its intricate workings and the interactions among various cells and molecules. This tiny yet powerful system is truly awe-inspiring."
第二个让我惊讶的是免疫学的不断演变。科学的进步如此之快，新的发现和理论不断涌现。我意识到要跟上这个领域的发展，我必须保持学习和持续进步。,"The second surprise was the constant evolution of immunology. Scientific advancements were happening at such a rapid pace, with new discoveries and theories emerging constantly. I realized that to keep up with the field, I had to embrace lifelong learning and continuous improvement."
最后，我对免疫学在医学领域中的广泛应用感到惊讶。它不仅仅是研究疾病的根源和治疗方法，还涉及到器官移植、免疫疗法等前沿领域。免疫学的应用潜力令人兴奋。,"Lastly, I was surprised by the wide-ranging applications of immunology in the field of medicine. It goes beyond studying the origins of diseases and treatment methods, extending to areas such as organ transplantation and immunotherapy. The potential for applying immunology is truly exciting."
让我分享一下我最伟大的工作成就。那是当我参与一个团队成功开发出一种新型疫苗时。这个疫苗可以有效预防一种致命疾病的传播。看到我的努力和研究成果能够拯救无数生命，那是一种无法言喻的成就感。,Let me share with you my greatest work achievement. It was when I was part of a team that successfully developed a novel vaccine. This vaccine effectively prevented the spread of a deadly disease. Seeing how my efforts and research could save countless lives was an indescribable sense of accomplishment.
然而，我也经历过最糟糕的失败。在一次重要的临床试验中，我们的疫苗并没有达到预期的效果。这个失败令我感到沮丧和失望。但我从中学到了宝贵的教训，明白失败是成长和改进的机会。,"However, I have also experienced my worst failure. In a crucial clinical trial, our vaccine didn't meet the expected efficacy. This failure left me feeling disheartened and disappointed. But I learned valuable lessons from it, understanding that failures are opportunities for growth and improvement."
最后，我想给那些刚刚踏入这个领域职业生涯的新人一些建议。首先，保持对知识的渴望和持续学习。免疫学是一个不断发展的领域，你需要与时俱进。其次，与同行保持合作和交流，共同推动科学的进步。最重要的是，永远热爱你的工作，对于每一个研究项目都保持激情和动力。,"Finally, I would like to offer some advice to newcomers who are just starting their careers in this field. Firstly, maintain a thirst for knowledge and a commitment to continuous learning. Immunology is a rapidly evolving field, and you need to stay updated. Secondly, foster collaboration and communication with peers to drive scientific progress together. And most importantly, always love what you do, and approach each research project with passion and drive."
在你的职业生涯中，你可能会遇到挑战和失败，但要记住，它们是你成长和进步的机会。坚持不懈，相信自己的能力，你将能够取得令人瞩目的成就。,"In your career, you may encounter challenges and failures, but remember, they are opportunities for growth and progress. Persevere, believe in your abilities, and you will achieve remarkable accomplishments."
感谢大家的聆听！愿你们在免疫学领域追求卓越，不断创新，为人类健康作出杰出贡献！,"Thank you all for listening! May you pursue excellence, innovation, and make outstanding contributions to human health in the field of immunology!"
