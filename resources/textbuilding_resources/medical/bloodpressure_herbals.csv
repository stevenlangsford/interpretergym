早上好，李女士。自上次就诊以来您过得怎么样？,"Good morning, Mrs. Lee. How have you been since our last visit?"
早上好，医生。我还好，只是最近有些压力。,"Good morning, Doctor. I've been alright, just dealing with some stress lately."
我理解。今天作为例行检查的一部分，我们将要检查您的血压。这是一个评估您心血管健康的重要测试。我们开始吧。我会给您的手臂上戴上袖带，然后测量您的血压。,"I understand. Today, during your routine checkup, we'll be checking your blood pressure. It's an essential test to assess your cardiovascular health. Let's proceed. I'll place the cuff around your arm and measure your blood pressure."
很抱歉告诉您，李女士，您的血压非常高。远远超过正常范围，表明您患有严重的高血压。,"I'm sorry to inform you, Mrs. Lee, but your blood pressure is extremely high. It's well above the normal range, indicating severe hypertension."
什么？这不可能！我不相信！肯定是你们的设备出了问题！,What?! This can't be right! I can't believe it! There must be something wrong with your equipment!
我理解这个消息让您感到不安，李女士，但是我们的设备是经过校准的，准确无误的。高血压是一种严重的疾病，需要引起重视。它会增加患心脏病和中风的风险。我们需要及时处理。,"I understand this news is unsettling, Mrs. Lee, but our equipment is calibrated and accurate. High blood pressure is a serious condition that requires attention. It puts you at risk for heart disease and stroke. We need to address it promptly."
我拒绝使用你们的药物！我听说有一种特定的中草药可以帮助很多人。我想先试试那个。,I refuse to take any of your medications! I have heard about a herbal remedy that has helped many people. I want to try that instead.
我理解您对替代疗法的兴趣，李女士。然而，需要谨慎对待。虽然一些中草药可能有潜在的益处，但重要的是记住它们没有像药物那样受到监管。没有科学证据和适当的医疗指导，使用中草药可能会导致治疗无效甚至产生不良反应。,"I appreciate your interest in alternative remedies, Mrs. Lee. However, it's important to approach them with caution. While some herbal remedies may have potential benefits, it's crucial to remember that they aren't regulated like medications. Without scientific evidence and proper medical guidance, there's a risk of ineffective treatment or even adverse effects."
我理解你的担忧，医生，但是我听说这种特定的中草药有很多成功的故事。它完全天然而且安全。我相信它对我有效。,"I understand your concerns, Doctor, but I've heard so many success stories about this specific herbal remedy. It's completely natural and safe. I believe it will work for me."
我理解您的观点，李女士，但是重要的是根据科学证据做出知情的决策。您提到的特定中草药可能有一些个人成功的故事，但是没有经过严格的临床研究，我们无法保证它对治疗高血压的有效性或安全性。我强烈建议您考虑经过科学研究证明有效的治疗方法。,"I understand your perspective, Mrs. Lee, but it's important to make informed decisions based on scientific evidence. The specific herbal remedy you mentioned may have anecdotal success stories, but without rigorous clinical studies, we can't guarantee its effectiveness or safety for managing high blood pressure. I strongly advise considering evidence-based treatments that have been proven effective in medical research."
我不相信那些研究！我想先尝试这种中草药，再考虑其他的！,I don't trust those studies! I want to try the herbal remedy first before considering anything else!
李女士，我理解您的不满，但是我最关心的是您的健康。我强烈建议您重新考虑并优先考虑经过科学验证的治疗方法。高血压需要仔细管理，仅依赖未经验证的疗法可能会延误或加重您的病情。不过，如果您坚持要尝试这种中草药，请随时告诉我有任何变化或效果。," Mrs. Lee, I understand your frustration, but my primary concern is your well-being. I strongly encourage you to reconsider and prioritize evidence-based treatments. High blood pressure requires careful management, and relying solely on unverified remedies might delay or worsen your condition. However, if you insist on trying the herbal remedy, please keep me informed about any changes or effects you experience."
好吧，我会考虑你的建议，但是我仍然相信这种中草药的疗效。,"Fine, I'll consider your advice, but I still believe in the power of this herbal remedy."
感谢您对其他选择持开放态度，李女士。请记住，我在这里支持您，帮助您做出对您的健康最有益的决策。如果您有任何进一步的问题或疑虑，请随时与我联系。让我们共同努力有效管理您的血压问题。,"Thank you for being open to considering other options, Mrs. Lee. Remember, I'm here to support you and help you make the best decisions for your health. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. Let's work together to manage your blood pressure effectively."
