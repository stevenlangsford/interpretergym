Let mempalace get texts from everywhere: the monologues it's using now, plus the bilang cloze texts which it can't currently see.

Adjust the width of settings input textboxes, some are too long.

Have the mempalace input text box expand to fit the text you're writing into it.

Add a back-to-main footer button throughout mempalace.


**FIGURE OUT A HOST: must support backend db.**

(then probably also can npm install chinese number dependency)

Put all the text resources in a psql database and fetch them as needed, carrying them around as js is real bad.

Add a 'track my stats' page to record pbs and/or time spent for each exercise

Revisit the n-back task: clone a 'real' presentation format and start collecting data? Can you see anything interesting re item interference?
